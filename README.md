Barcode Battler is a legendary toy released in 1991 by [EPOCH](https://epoch.jp/).

This is an attempt to recreate the Barcode Battler experience using React.js + [QuaggaJS](https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/) + Yahoo Shopping API.

**NOTE: Items which have barcodes but are not listed in Yahoo Shopping can not be scanned.**

In the battle, users have a choice of either
- BARCODE ATTACK (attacks opponent using values calculated from JAN code and # of Yahoo Shopping hits)
- YAHOO POTION (multiplies the attack value by how well the item is rated on Yahoo Shopping)

Let's figure out what the strongest product in the market is.
